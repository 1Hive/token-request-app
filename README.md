# Token Request App

An Aragon app that allows someone to request native tokens from a DAO in exchange for another token (ANT/ETH/DAI).

<br>

## What is it?

The Token Request App would enable anyone to create a vote to mint tokens for themselves
- it should allow users to include a payment (eth or tokens) that is returned to them if they are rejected, or put in the DAO's vault if the request is approved
- should allow the DAO to configure a minimum payment required

## What is it used for?

It could help formalize the process of becoming a member of a DAO in a way that would generalize well to other organizations. 
- In the context of 1Hive, this could require potential members to first earn HONEY via tasks/allocations, then stake that HONEY to their membership request for BEEs to vote on.

It would allow a DAO to accept outside contributions from donors, grants, and/or projects that want to engage with a DAO's community to get stuff done.
- In the context of 1Hive, this could allow outside orgs to support the hive in a direct way that allows them to measure the impact/result of their contributions. It also illiminates any potential drama/failure that would result from the DAO receiving funds, but not knowing what to do with them and/or investing them poorly. It also creates an interim fundraising mechanism for the MVP until we have [Apiary](https://github.com/1Hive/apiary) setup.

## What open problems need to be solved?

We need to start building the app.

We need to decide what the base rate of exchange is for the DAO's native token (HONEY) because there is no automatic price discovery like there would be with a bonding curve or open market.

Unknown unknowns that are not listed here ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
